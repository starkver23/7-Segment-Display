# 7-Segment-Display


Hey there! it's Aryan Verma this side. 
Today I will be talking about my second project which I made for my college course. 
This project is called 7 segment display. 
The tools used in this car are Arduino uno, 7 segment display, wire and jumpers. 
I encourage you all to drop in your advices and improve it if possible. 
This will boost me up and help me in making more projects like this.
